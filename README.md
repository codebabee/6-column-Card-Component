I'm Peculiar, a learner at the SGA programme. Recently, we've been taught html and css, with empahsis on positioning and layout this week.

So I decided to try this out and used this project to practise the usage of flexbox for responsiveness, and also to learn about positioning and layout.

Tachnologies involved are HTML and CSS.
